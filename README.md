# Description
This is a repository for all of my Beat Saber Maps and other things I do. I will list whatever I used to make them, such as Vanilla Beatsaber, Remapper, or HeckLib. 
You may use the files and effects in this repo to **LEARN** as well as use the code(preferably not but if you want to use an effect in a map then you can) just **PLEASE** give credit. 
Again, you must **give credit** to me in the script(if you put the script anywhere such as Github) and map description!

# Updated Nootils(WIP)

As Remapper updates I will do my best to keep the functions from Nootils updated.
[Latest Update](https://github.com/IntoTheAbyss490/MapScriptsAndFiles/tree/main/Updated%20Nootils/3.1.2) 

All credit goes to the contributors found [here](https://github.com/StormPacer/nootils)
**I will be PR-ing everything into the nootils repo, but I will leave the code here aswell(for EOA for me)**

**How To use The Functions:**

Copy and paste the Functions into your script, and call it AFTER the function with all specified parameters.
You can also copy and paste the imports and deno argument if you need to.
*If there are any issues with the code or whatever, let me know in the issues.*
*I barely check GitHub so don't expect a quick response*
**Do NOT DM me*

One more thing, I have made maps before making this repo, however, those maps will not be here, **SORRY**

Have fun, learn some stuff, and don't be mean:)
